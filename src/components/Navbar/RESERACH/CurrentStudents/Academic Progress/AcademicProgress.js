												Sydney IBS research candidates are required to meet a
												number of progress milestones including an initial
												Annual Plan, completion of Research Integrity Training,
												Annual Plan & Reports, the Thesis Proposal Review, and
												the final Oral Presentation of your research. These
												milestones are valuable project management tools that
												can help you and your supervisor set research goals,
												reflect on your research activities, and ensure you are
												on track for successful completion of your program.
											</p>
											<p>
												Your School or Centre may require additional milestones
												such as a Mid-Year Review or completion of ethics
												requirements, or you may be required to do some
												coursework during your program, but before submitting
												your thesis. All Sydney IBS candidates are required to
												meet satisfactory academic progress. This means that
												they must meet the minimum academic performance
												requirements as established by the University and
												determined by the Delegated Authority (DA). What
												constitutes satisfactory academic progress depends on
												the level of the program or, in some circumstances,
												requirements specific to an individual program.
											</p>
											<p>
												Candidates will be notified of other requirements to
												maintain satisfactory progress. All candidates should be
												aware of the{" "}
												<span className="text-sky-700 cursor-pointer underline">
													Research Awards Rule
												</span>{" "}
												which govern all research programs at Sydney IBS.
												Candidates can log in to{" "}
												<span className="text-sky-700 cursor-pointer underline">
													ISIS
												</span>{" "}
												to see which milestones have already been completed and
												upcoming due dates and to commence a milestone report.
												Milestone reports are created as eForms, and are
												designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Upon
												submission, your milestone report will be electronically
												directed to the Chair of your supervisory pa
