												The PhD program consists of two components– coursework

											<h1 className="text-md  font-bold text-black mt-3 mb-3">
												PhD coursework component
											</h1>
											<p>
												In the coursework component, PhD candidates undertake a
												comprehensive set of courses designed to provide
												training in the theory and methods necessary to conduct
												high-quality business research. These courses are
												academically rigorous and will be examined. Candidates
												take up to 18 months to complete the coursework, a total
												of 36 units of credit (UOC). The 36UOC worth of
												coursework that you are required to complete has a core
												component consisting of 24UOC and a disciplinary
												component of 12UOC from a selection of units. Upon
												successful completion of the coursework, PhD candidates
												will progress to the research component.{" "}
											</p>
											<p className="mt-3">
												The standard coursework structure for the PhD is as
												follows:
											</p>

											<h1 className="mt-3">
												<span className="font-bold text-black">Core units</span>{" "}
												– each unit is 6UOC. You will be required to complete
												all three units from this list:
												<ul className="mt-3">
													<li> BUSN1131 Philosophy of Business Research</li>
													<li> BUSN1133 Research Methodology</li>

												</ul>

											<h1 className="text-md  font-bold text-black my-3">
												PhD research component
											</h1>
											<p>
												Following the successful completion of coursework, PhD
												candidates undertake research training and independent
												research. Research training begins in the second year
												with higher degree research seminars and workshops,
												where participants delve deeply into key current
												research papers to determine research approaches to
												take. At the same time, PhD candidates will commence
												research in their chosen topic. The year culminates with
												the defence of the first research proposal, known as the
												thesis Proposal Defence (PD). The PD is a major
												milestone towards the end of the second year. The
												purpose of the PD is to assess the originality,
												significance, adequacy, and achievability of the
												candidate’s thesis plan.
											</p>
											<p>
												PhD candidates are required to submit a draft thesis
												proposal for their PD towards the end of Semester 1 in
												the second year of their candidature. The proposal
												includes a description of the research to be undertaken
												in the thesis, and a summary of the thesis structure and
												time plan. Candidates are required to give a
												presentation to the supervisory panel and others to
												provide constructive feedback about your progress.
											</p>
											<h1 className="text-md  font-bold text-black my-3">
												Research supervisory panel
											</h1>
											<p>
												Sydney IBS uses a panel system of supervision. You will
												have a panel of at least two supervisors, one of whom is
												designated as principal supervisor, the other(s) as
												co-supervisor. The role of the supervisory panel is to
												assist, advise, and provide support and encouragement to
												the candidate for a timely and successful completion of
												the research thesis. You will work closely with them to
												define your research question and develop your thesis.
												You need to review the profiles of our faculty to look
												at the areas of research covered at the school. If you
												feel that you are interested in a particular research
												area and working with a specific faculty member, then
												you need to contact the faculty in advance of making
												your application and note this within your application.
											</p>
											<h1 className="text-md  font-bold text-black my-3">
												HDR colloquium
											</h1>
											<p>
												The annual HDR Colloquium is an opportunity for PhD
												candidates to present and connect with other like minds
												from across the school. Share your thesis work, receive
												feedback, and develop your research networks. PhD
												candidates are expected to attend and actively
												participate in the colloquiums throughout their
												candidature.
											</p>
											<h1 className="text-md  font-bold text-black my-3">
												Research integrity training
											</h1>
											<p>
												All PhD candidates must complete the Research Integrity
												Training and pass the exam within three to six months of
												enrolment. Completion of this course and exam is a
												compulsory milestone for all PhD candidates. For more
												information on research integrity training, please visit
												our page.
											</p>
											<h1 className="text-md  font-bold text-black my-3">
												Annual progress reviews
											</h1>
											<p>
												It is Sydney IBS policy that each candidate’s progress
												be reviewed periodically. In each year of their program,
												PhD candidates are required to submit an annual plan and
												report as a basis for periodic progress review. This
												document provides details on work completed by the
												candidate since the previous review, current progress,
												and any problems that may impact their research. It also
												outlines the coursework and research the candidate
												intends to undertake in the following 12 months.
											</p>
											<h1 className="text-md  font-bold text-black my-3">
												Thesis submission and examination
											</h1>
											<p>
												The culmination of the PhD in Islamic Business is a
												written thesis which, upon completion, is submitted for
												examination. The thesis is assessed by examiners who are
												experts in the relevant field. For more information on
												the process, visit our page on submitting a thesis.
