								WHAT’S NEXT FOR ISLAMIC BANKING?{" "}

								Islamic Banking, some 30 years after its emergence, is now at
								what appears to be an inflection point. Despite impressive
								growth and expansion, it is in need of rejuvenation as it
								approaches the second stage of development. In Muslim nations
								where they have been introduced, Islamic banking has been
								well-received thanks to latent demand from the Muslim populace.
								Looking back, the initial years have indeed been easy. Islamic
								banking expanded by merely replicating conventional products in
								shariah-compliant ways. Replication was a sensible strategy
								given the novelty of Islamic banking at that time. Products that
								looked and behaved like conventional banking instruments were
								easily acceptable to a customer base attuned to conventional
								banking products and services. Mimicking made penetration and
								expansion easy. Islamic banking had simply to reap the low
								hanging fruits. And indeed it did, growing to now exceed a
								trillion US $ in assets. Having now outgrown its infancy, both
								the industry and its stakeholders realise where mere replication
								has led them. Today Islamic banks have the same problems and
								outcomes as conventional banking. Replication has led to a heavy
								reliance on debt type, risk transfer rather than the risk
								sharing instruments prescribed by shariah. Ijarah, Murabaha and
								other fixed-rate contracts dominate the asset side of most
								Islamic Bank balance sheets. In countries like Malaysia,
								commodity Murabaha and other fixed-rate financing account close
								to 80% of assets. Even where Musharakah and Mudaraba labels are
								used, contract specifications effectively avoid risk
								sharing/taking. Ironically, since Islamic banks do not have the
								vast array of risk management tools available to conventional
								banks, their reliance on fixed rate financing on the asset side
								implies even larger duration gaps. This, in turn, implies that
								Islamic banks have even larger exposure to rate changes!

							<p className="mt-3 font-serif text-justify">
								As we take stock and look ahead, it is obvious that continuing
								on the same easy path would mean full convergence and potential
								irrelevance. Already growth rates are tapering. There is a need
								to pull away from path dependency and towards maqasid
								al-shariah. True rejuvenation for the industry can only come
								from a movement away from fixed-rate contracts and into
								risk-sharing ones like mudaraba and musyarakah. Such a move
								would require much change. Among bankers, a change in mindsets,
								banking operations/ processes and customer relationships. Risk
								sharing would require a level of analysis that is much more
								in-depth than credit analysis. Customers and clients have to be
								educated about the need to take risks in order to earn returns,
								if the returns are to be shariah-compliant. Policymakers would
								have to put in place banking regulation that does not bias
								against risk taking by Islamic banks. Tax neutrality on
								sale/purchase of underlying assets would help. Finally,
								institutions established to set standards for Islamic banking,
								the likes of IFSB, must realign standards to be supportive of
								risk sharing. Currently, the use of Mudarabah/ Musyarakah type
								contracts by Islamic banks result in higher capital adequacy
								requirements.
							</p>
							<p className="mt-3 font-serif text-justify">
								These changes are necessary if Islamic banking is to play a more
								meaningful role in economic development. Shariah, in requiring
								financing to be rooted in real sector activities, requires banks
								to be partners rather than mere intermediaries. The prohibition
								of a predetermined interest rate is in many ways a requirement
								for risk-sharing partnerships. For an Islamic bank, risk sharing
								can and should be on both sides of the balance sheet. While the
								bank shares in the risks by sharing in the profits and losses of
								the businesses it funds, it links the returns it provides
								depositors based on its own returns. In essence, depositors
								would be participating in the underlying business through their
								bank. One would be tempted to ask how such a model is superior,
								how would the returns compare and isn’t this exposing depositors
								to more risks? The answer is yes, there would be more risks to
								depositors, but it would be well worth the higher returns. To
								understand why this so, one needs to merely compare real sector
								returns with contemporary bank deposit returns. The average
								Return on Assets for a 100 plus listed industry sectors across
								the world, from Morningstar, a US-based financial information
								provider is, approximately 14% for 5 years and 15% for 3 years.
								Yet, bank deposits would have provided a mere 2 to 4% average
								annual returns. While real sector returns are about 5 times
								more, the risk isn’t that much more. Thus, on a risk-return
								basis, depositors ought to be much better off. More important
								than this, is the benefit that the proposed model holds in terms
								of vastly reduced economic vulnerability given the absence of
								leverage arising from fractional banking and the reduced
								contingent liability to governments from deposit guarantee and
								bank bailouts.
