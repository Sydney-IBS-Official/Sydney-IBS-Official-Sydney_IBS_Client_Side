									Size matters in banking in more ways than one. As an industry
									with extensive economies of scale and huge overheads, volume
									is key.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2  text-justify font-serif">
									To be cost competitive, the high fixed costs need to be spread
									out over a large number of transactions. This necessitates a
									substantial size.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2  text-justify font-serif">
									Economics aside, size is also important because banking
									revolves around faith and confidence. Thus, being big with
									plenty of assets and an extensive footprint certainly helps
									with perception. Even so, as with all things in economics,
									there are trade-offs. When banks get too large, two things can
									happen.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2  text-justify font-serif">
									First, over expansion can, and will, cause efficiency to fall.
									This can translate into higher management and administrative
									costs, lower quality of credit provided, and so, lower
									profitability. While these are internal factors, there can
									also be external pressures that arise when a bank gets too
									big.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									Given the recent experience with bank induced systemic risks
									and financial crises, regulators fret when a bank gets to be
									too big. Due to the interlocking nature of the banking
									business, if a big bank trips up, it has the potential to
									bring down the entire banking system.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									In such cases the government is obliged to save the bank in
									order to avoid a systemic crisis. Thus, the term “too big to
									fail”.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									Unfortunately, the moral hazard surrounding the too big to
									fail phenomenon is so extensive that it is now deemed
									unacceptable by regulators.So, while size is important in
									banking, there clearly are trade-offs. On the one hand, banks
									have to be of a size large enough to reap the economies of
									scale and benefit from the cost efficiencies, while on the
									other hand, they should not be too big to be a potential for
									systemic risk. From a policy viewpoint, what this implies is
									that there may be an optimal size. While there have been
									studies that examined the issue of optimal bank size and the
									consequences of an inappropriate size, they have mostly been
									in the context of developed countries.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									There has been little work on bank size in developing
									countries and even less for the Islamic banks therein.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									To address this, a recent study at the International Centre
									for Education in Islamic Finace or INCEIF examined 249 banks
									across 12 developing Islamic countries with dual banking
									systems. The sample included 63 Islamic banks across the 12
									countries.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									Aside from examining the impact of size on performance, the
									study addressed two key questions. First, does bank size have
									the same impact on the performance of Islamic banks as it does
									for conventional ones?
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									Second, are the Islamic banks of an appropriate size to be
									competitive or could they be too small to succeed?
								</p>
								<p className="mt-2 font-serif text-justify">
									A bank’s asset size was compared relative to its profitability
									and cost efficiency. Across all 249 banks, the results show a
									clear trade-off. Banks with asset size below US$2 billion
									(RM8.22 billion) would not be cost efficient even if they may
									be making some profits.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									Efficiency begins to rise when banks reach an asset size of
									about US$2 billion. Both cost efficiency and profitability
									continue rising as asset size grows; however, as asset size
									gets beyond US$5 billion, profitability peaks, turning down
									sharply beyond about US$7 billion. The sizes here seem small,
									mainly because the sample constitutes banks from developing
									Islamic countries.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									Still, the trade-offs seen here appear to be the same as those
									documented for developed country banks, only of a larger
									scale.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									From a macro-policy viewpoint, this trade-off can be
									diminished by improvements in financial system infrastructure
									and prudential oversight.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									The fact that developed country banks have been documented to
									have much higher optimal sizes than those found in this study,
									has to do with the better developed financial system
									infrastructure and more effective oversight.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									Interestingly, within the Islamic banking space, the study
									finds the sector is characterised by a large number of small
									banks competing more among themselves than with their
									conventional peers. It appears that Islamic banks, given their
									smallness, are clearly disadvantaged when it comes to
									economies of scale.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									The situation is worsened by the extensive compliance costs
									that further disadvantage small banks. Islamic banks may also
									be handicapped by technology which, given the heavy upfront
									investment, require a substantial bank size to be justifiable.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-2 font-serif text-justify">
									The study clearly points to the fact that many, if not most,
									of the Islamic banks in developing countries may be too small
									to be competitive or to contribute meaningfully to their
									economies. For policymakers in countries with Islamic banks
									within their dual banking systems, their challenge may not be
									to prevent too big to fail, but rather to ensure the Islamic
									banks are not too small to succeed!
