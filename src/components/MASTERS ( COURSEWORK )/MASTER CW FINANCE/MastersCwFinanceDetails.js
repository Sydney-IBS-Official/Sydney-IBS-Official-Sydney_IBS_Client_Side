									Supervision
								</h1>

									As a MPhil. candidate you will be assigned two initial
									supervisors who will guide you through your first year. They
									will help you to identify your specialist area of interest and
									further suitable advisers in that field. You will work closely
									with them to define your research question and develop your
									thesis. It is an important relationship and also a very
									personal one: it is shaped by you, your supervisors, and the
									ways you interact. You do not need to contact any faculty in
									advance of making your application, but you can review the
									profiles of our faculty to look for at the areas of research
									covered at the School. You can note within your application if
									you feel that you are interested in a particular research area
									and working with a specific faculty member.
